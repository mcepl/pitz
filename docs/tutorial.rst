How to start using pitz
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The goal here is for me to walk you through how to start using pitz.

Set up a project
================

Pretend that I'm starting work on a project named frotz::

    $ mkdir frotz && cd frotz

Run this command (added to your path when you ran easy_install
pitz)::

    $ pitz-setup

You'll get asked lots of questions, and at the end, get dumped back out
to the command line, and a fancy new pitzdir directory will hold your
stuff.

Tell your source control system to ignore some files
====================================================

You should **not** track changes in these files, since they do stuff
like cache data for quicker retrieval and protect against multiple
processes working simultaneously on the same data.

*   project.pickle
*   pitz.pid

me.yaml
-------

The me.yaml file can be tracked as long as you know you're the only one on the
project.  If many people have checkouts, each person's me.yaml file
should be different, and so you should not track changes to it.

git example
-----------

I always add these lines to my .gitignore file::

    pitzdir/project.pickle
    pitzdir/pitz.pid
    pitzdir/me.yaml


Create a task
=============

::

    $ pitz-add-task

You'll get asked for a title, a description, a milestone, an estimate, and for
components.


List stuff to do
================

::

    $ pitz-todo
    /==================
    frotz: stuff to do
    ==================

    (1 tasks)

    64ff76  Wash dishes
            no owner | unstarted | not estimated | unscheduled | no components
            Scrub scrub scrub scrub


Notice that **64ff76** -- that's the first six letters of your task's UUID,
which is a universally unique identifier.  I call it "the frag" and you can use
a frag to identify an entity.


See detail on a single task
===========================

Use the entity's frag to see all the details::

    $ pitz-show 64ff76
    Wash dishes
    ===========

    no owner | unstarted | not estimated | unscheduled | no components

    Description
    -----------
    Scrub scrub scrub scrub

    Attributes

    type              : task

    uuid              : 64ff7656-d5b7-4f56-b506-714d44d8b3a5


Introduce yourself to pitz
==========================

Try to start working on the "Wash dishes" task::

    $ pitz-start-task 64ff76

It blew up because pitz doesn't know who you are.  Fix that like this::

    $ pitz-add-person
