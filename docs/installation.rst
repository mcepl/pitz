Install pitz
++++++++++++

Until I release 1.0, I suggest cloning the repository at github::

    $ git clone git://github.com/mw44118/pitz.git

Then, install pitz like this::

    $ cd pitz
    $ python setup.py develop

You might need sudo in front of that second line if you're not using a
virtualenv.

Finally, there's an optional bash_completion.bash file that sets up tab
completion. To use that, add these lines to the end of your ~/.bashrc::

    # Pitz stuff to enable tab completion on fragments.
    source $HOME/checkouts/pitz/bash_completion.bash

Of course, you may need to change that line to point to where that file
lives on your box.
