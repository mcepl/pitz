description: 'Right now, when you look at a task, you don''t know if there comments

  attached to it.


  That''s a specific scenario.  More generally, any time an entity is

  pointed at by another entity, I''m not showing that information.


  It would be useful to be able to see stuff like the number of comments

  linked to a task, or the number of tasks linked to a milestone, etc,

  when looking at the main entity.
