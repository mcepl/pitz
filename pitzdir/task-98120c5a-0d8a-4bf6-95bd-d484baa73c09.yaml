description: "It would be nice to be able to do either of these::\n\n    $ pitz add\
  \ task \n    $ pitz task add\n\nand pitz would run the same underlying function.\n\
  \nAnother example::\n\n    $ pitz edit abc123 title\n    $ pitz abc123 edit title\n\
  \nThose should do the same thing.\n\nInstead of having to choose how to construct\
  \ a grammar for pitz at the\ncommand-line, I'll just allow many different synonymous\
  \ commands."
