description: 'When I used the app on a remote server, I discovered it wasn''t as fast

  as I wanted it to be.


  The problem is from sending the big ol'' jquery-latest.js and

  jquery-ui-latest.js files down the wire.


  And the pitz.css file is growing steadily also.


  Anyhow, there''s an easy fix -- the StaticHandler should be smart enough

  to tell the browser to cache these files.


  Then it should also be smart enough to know when it can reply with a 304

  (not modified) or a new 200.'
