description: "This will make a bag with all tasks attached to the first milestone::\n\
  \n    >>> m1 = p.milestones[0]\n    >>> p.tasks(milestone=m1)\n\nI can't do this\
  \ easily from the command line.  I wish I could something\nlike this:\n\n    $ pitz-everything\
  \ type=milestone\n      ==============\n      subset of Pitz\n      ==============\n\
  \n      (2 milestone entities)\n      ----------------------\n\n         0: d734c3\
  \ Mythical 1.0 release: 100% complete (30 / 30 tasks)\n         1: b956c9 2.0: 0%\
  \ complete (0 / 1 tasks)\n\n\nAnd then feed in the UUID frag for the milestone into\
  \ pitz-everything\nlike this::\n\n    $ pitz-everything type=task milestone=d734c3\n\
  \nI think the simplest thing would be a function that takes an input\nstring like\
  \ d734c3 and then decides if that matches one and only one\nentity in the project.\n\
  \nIf so, I could replace the ugly string with with the entity.\n"
