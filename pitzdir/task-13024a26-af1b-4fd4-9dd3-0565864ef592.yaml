description: 'Right now, pitz uses a separate YAML file for each entity, and pitz
  does

  **a lot** of work to handle references between yaml files.


  Although initially I figured I would be manually editing yaml files,

  now, I''m not.


  So now I should experiment with a new backend that doesn''t use separate

  yaml files.


  Maybe I could use just one single yaml file.  Or just use a pickle.'
