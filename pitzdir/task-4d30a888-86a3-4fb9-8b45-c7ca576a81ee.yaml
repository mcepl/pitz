description: 'There''s lots of ways to do this.  In the beginning, I want to write
  a

  command-line script that reads from STDIN or from a file.


  The script will use the email subject for the task title and use the

  body for the description.


  Later on I might write docs to show how to use procmail or something

  else to run this script automatically for certain addresses or certain

  email subjects.


  For example, I could set up a new-task@tplus1.com address that

  automatically creates a new task for each email it gets.'
