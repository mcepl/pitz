description: 'This weekend I spent lots of time monkeying with pitz when I tried to

  set it up in a new virtualenv.


  First I realized that the clepy package on pypi was out of date, so I

  had to upload the newer versions of clepy.


  Then I found that the more recent version of mock, 0.5, caused some

  tests to fail, so I had to configure pitz to use mock 0.4.


  I don''t think pitz will work on python 2.5 because I dropped the

  dependency on multiprocessing, since that is now part of the standard

  library.


  In summary, I spent a whole bunch of time handling all the issues that

  any new user would go through.


  I need to figure out some way of automating this process and testing it

  so that I know once something is broken.


  Maybe this is what buildbot is good for...
