description: 'I did a stock install of pitz 1.0.6 to track abais work.


  Then I made a bunch of tasks.


  Then I upgraded to pitz 1.0.7.


  Then I made more tasks.


  Somehow, the order method for pitz-todo got to be different than the

  order method for pitz-my-todo.


  Not sure how that happened.


  Instead of investigating abais, I should set up a bogus new install,

  then make a bunch of tasks, and then see if the problem happens again.'
