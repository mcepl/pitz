description: "This IRC session explains the problem::\n\n    18:42 < mw44118> So,\
  \ can somebody explain what is so bad about\n    subclassing list?\n    18:43 <\
  \ KirkMcDonald> mw44118: The methods of the list type do not\n    perform virtual\
  \ calls on its other methods.\n    18:43 < dash> mw44118: and since list's existing\
  \ methods won't call\n    your code, you have to override everything anyway\n  \
  \  18:43 < mw44118> KirkMcDonald: is that also true when subclassing\n    dict?\n\
  \    18:43 < dash> yes\n    18:43 < KirkMcDonald> mw44118: Yes.\n    18:44 < mw44118>\
  \ KirkMcDonald: I came across that issue with dict.\n    I defined my own __setitem__,\
  \ then discovered self.update() ignored\n    my own.\n    18:44 < KirkMcDonald>\
  \ Indeed.\n    18:44 < mw44118> KirkMcDonald: so, should I use a composition\n \
  \   approach, and have a self._data object of type list or dict?\n    18:44 < dash>\
  \ i'd recommend it\n    18:45 < KirkMcDonald> mw44118: Yes, this is what I would\
  \ recommend.\n    18:45 < mw44118> KirkMcDonald: thanks for the help.\n\nIn other\
  \ words, a subclass of list won't use my __getitem__ on its own\ninternal calls\
  \ to stuff."
