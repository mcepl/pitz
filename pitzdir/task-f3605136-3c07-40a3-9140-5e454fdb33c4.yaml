description: "Right now, the Task.interesting_attributes view looks a little like\
  \ this::\n\n    matt | started | straightforward | 1.0 | 0\n\nThis looks great in\
  \ a plain text format.  For reStructuredText, though,\nI'll want to do something\
  \ like this::\n\n    matt_ | started_ | straightforward_ | 1.0_ | 0\n\n    .. _owner:\
  \ Person/by_title/matt\n    .. _status: Status/by_title/started\n    .. _estimate:\
  \ Estimate/by_title/straightforward\n    .. _milestone: Milestone/by_title/1.0\n\
  \nAll that extra linkage stuff is meaningless when just outputting text,\nbut is\
  \ very useful for converting to other formats.\n\nInitially, I wanted to have pitz\
  \ start by writing out reST for\neverything and then write a new parser to strip\
  \ out that markup.\n\nIn other words, the flow would look like::\n\n    entity ->\
  \ reStructuredText view -> parser -> plain text view\n\nThat parser doesn't already\
  \ exist, and furthermore, I don't like the\nidea any more of one object having just\
  \ a single view.\n\nInstead, now, I'm thinking that each entity has numerous views,\
  \ all\nbeing-first class, like this::\n\n    entity -> reStructuredText view\n \
  \   entity -> plain text view\n    entity -> colorized text view\n    entity ->\
  \ HTML view\n\nAnd the advantage of this is that then (brace yourself) I can also\
  \ do\nwacky shit like::\n\n    entity -> YAML view\n    entity -> SQL view\n\nSo,\
  \ the view can really be thought of as a serialization layer."
