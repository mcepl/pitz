description: 'Right now, I''m using comments to track status changes.  So, every time
  I

  alter the status of a task, for example, I create a comment that tracks

  who changed it, the old and the new value, and the time it happened.


  The effect is that now entities have LOTS of comments, and it isn''t easy

  to tell a real human''s comment from one of these automatically generated

  comments.


  If somebody is using a VCS system to track pitz files, all this

  information is available in there.


  Maybe I''m doing something in pitz that would be better handled by a

  separate tool.


  On the other hand, if somebody is just using a web app, without yaml

  files, and just the pickle, then there isn''t any historical tracking.'
