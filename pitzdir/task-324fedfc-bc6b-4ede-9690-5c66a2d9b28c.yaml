description: "It is possible to do this::\n\n    $ pitz-show abc123 | rst2pdf > abc123.pdf\n\
  \nAnd then view a pretty PDF version of task abc123.\n\nI had to tweak the template\
  \ used by pitz-show-task so that it would\noutput stuff with restructured text syntax.\n\
  \nNow I should do the same thing for the detailed view property on bags.\n\nRight\
  \ now, this is what the detailed view of a bag looks like::\n\n    $ pitz-my-todo\
  \ -n 3\n    ==============================\n    slice from To-do list for matt\n\
  \    ==============================\n\n    (3 task entities)\n\n    Make bag summarized\
  \ view compatible with rst tools             324fed\n    matt | started | difficult\
