description: "Right now, a task's summarized view shows:\n\n*   frag\n*   title\n\
  *   status\n\nIt might also be nice to show these attributes:\n\n*   owner\n*  \
  \ milestone\n*   components\n\nHowever, in some contexts, this information might\
  \ be redundant.  For\nexample,  I might list a bunch of tasks after sorting them\
  \ by milestone,\nlike this::\n\n    milestone 1.0\n    -------------\n        abc123\
  \  some task           (unstarted)\n        def456  another task        (unstarted)\n\
  \n    milestone 1.5\n    -------------\n        ghi789  yet another task    (unstarted)\n\
  \n\nIn that example, it would be silly to list the milestone on each row.\n\nSo,\
  \ I think what I really need to do is make the summarized view be\nsmart enough\
  \ to pay attention to the context where it displays."
