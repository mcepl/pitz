description: 'Right now, pitz takes the first six characters from the UUID and then

  uses that for a unique identifier.


  It is possible that this won''t work, especially in a project with many

  entities.


  It is better to just show the minimum required characters to get a

  unique ID.  In a two-entity project, the minimum is likely to be one

  letter.


  In a project with tens of thousands of entities, it might be necessary

  to type out the whole dang UUID.


  Anyhow, pitz should figure that out and print the frag that is

  guaranteed to be unique.
