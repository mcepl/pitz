description: "Right now when I create an entity, I have to add an attribute-value\
  \ pair\nexplicitly to track who created it.\n\nThe same issue happens when I comment\
  \ on the entity.\n\nIt would be nicer if pitz somehow recognized who I am and then\
  \ always\ntracked that with each action.\n\nGit handles this by creating a .git/config\
  \ in the project.  \n\nMaybe our system could just list all the defined users and\
  \ then ask \"who\nare you?\"\n"
