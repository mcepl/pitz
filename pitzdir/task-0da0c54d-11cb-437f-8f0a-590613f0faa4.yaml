description: 'Right now, all my tests live in a top-level tests folder.


  It might be better to put tests next to the code they test.  For

  example, the tests for pitz.webapp.handlers would be in

  pitz.webapp.handlers.tests.


  When I install pitz right now, I don''t copy the tests folder into

  site-packages.  If I mix the tests in with the code, when I install

  pitz, I would probably not want to move the test code in.


  So I would need to rewrite the setup.py script to be smart enough not to

  copy those files into the tree.


  Really though, before I do anything, I should post to some python

  packaging mailing list and ask what other people are doing.'
