description: 'The top-level screen of the app should be a little friendlier than just

  a dump of every entity in the project.


  That screen should exist, but it probably belongs under a URL like

  /everything or /Entity/all.


  The top page should be what a non-technical client can go to and

  navigate, to get an idea about what is going on with the project.'
