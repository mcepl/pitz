description: "Right now, it is possible to store a list in a value and it will survive\n\
  going to and from yaml.  However queries will not match.  Example::\n\n    >>> t\
  \ = Task(p, tags=['a', 'b'])\n    >>> p(tags='a')\n\nIn other words, the query to\
  \ get all entities with tags == 'a' will\nfail, because the entity runs this comparison::\n\
  \n    >>> ['a', 'b'] == 'a'\n\nInstead, when the initial Entity.matches_dict call\
  \ fails, we should test\nif either element is a sequence, and then test for membership.\n\
  \n"
