description: 'I''ve been seeing a confusing intermittent bug, and I think I figured
  it out.


  I will open a pitz-shell in one terminal and then use pitz-add in

  another window.  After pitz-add finishes, it adds the new yaml file and

  updates the pickle cache.


  At this point, there is new data in the project that I want to load into

  the pitz-shell session.


  Right now, when I close the pitz-shell session, it overwrites the pickle

  with the new task with a pickle file that contains just the data loaded

  into the pitz-shell session.


  Luckilly, the yaml file still has the original data, so nothing is

  permanently lost, but I have to manually delete the project.pickle.'
