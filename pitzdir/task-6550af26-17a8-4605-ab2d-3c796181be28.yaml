description: 'The way to tell pitz where the project data lives is kind of messy.

  Ideally, the user should just say "the pitzdir is here".  Maybe that''s

  an option.


  If no pitzdir is specified, pitz should search for it.


  When a pitzdir is found, first pitz should check for a project.pickle.

  If that exists, and it is not stale, then pitz should load it.


  Otherwise, pitz should look for a project.yaml file.


  All of this needs to be defined in a single place so each script can

  easily have all these rules.
