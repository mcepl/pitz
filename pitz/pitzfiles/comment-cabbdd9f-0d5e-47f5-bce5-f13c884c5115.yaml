  \ to me before now.  \n\nRight now, in order to start up pitz-shell, I type in the\
  \ absolute path\nto the project.yaml file.\n\nI think it might be better to pass\
  \ in just the path to the directory\nwith everything as a variable named PITZDIR,\
  \ and everything could be\nrelative to that.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"
