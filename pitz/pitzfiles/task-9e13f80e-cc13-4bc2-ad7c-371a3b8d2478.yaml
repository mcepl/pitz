description: 'Figure out how to allow end-user to modify their projects on a

  per-project basis.


  I need to figure out how to copy python files into the pitzfiles

  directory.  This is tricky because I''m not certain where my pitz project

  will be installed.  I think using pkg_resources might be the way.


  After figuring that out, I need to change the pitz-shell script to make

  sure it reads the local python files for the project rather than the

  whatever was originally installed.
